## Boxes on Boxes

Can't believe it's been a month since I last posted! Woops. It is so easy to lose track of the things you want to do when something like a job search comes up. I tell myself that is fine because it is because I've been focused on my job search, which it is, but it doesn't mean I have zero time for the other things I want to do. Interview season should wind down in about a month though, and then I can dive further into my creative pursuits.

Luckily, I have kept drawing, just at a slower pace. This boxes exercise was so useful, especially the one with the organic perspective exercise. This exercise felt more wholistic as if I were creating a landscape or fully-formed idea. It felt less of an exercise than the others. I can't wait until more of these exercises incorporate some creativity.

I think another thing I want to do is take time to draw whatever I want to draw. When I only do these exercises, it is hard to see how this is going to help me create my fantasy landscapes or bring my characters to life.

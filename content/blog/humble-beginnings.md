## Humble Beginnings

I drew a little bit of anime as a kid (as most nerds do at one point or another) and found it to be pretty fun -- so I thought, what the heck maybe I can do writing more seriously. It's relaxing and it's something I can do to wind down at the end of the day. Plus, if I stick with it, there's a chance I'll eventually, hopefully be able to draw something I'm proud of.

As a kid, I was much more impulsive about what I did in my free time (probably since there was much more of it going around). If I wanted to make a youtube video, I'd do that. If I wanted to write some music, I'd do that. If I wanted to draw some runescape fanart, I'd do that too. I didn't worry about how *good* the result was. There's a certain freedom that comes with being a child, and I'd like to return to that -- just let myself do things I want to do for the heck of doing them.

Once I got into high school, my creativity was severely dampened by the demands of getting good grades and applying to colleges (fun times). This continued into college as well. But now that I have a bit more time, and I've come to realize how increasingly boring I've become (my younger self would be so disappointed), I want to act more on my impulses and *create* something without worrying about what it is or how good it is.

## Plan

My goal is to practice drawing daily by following the lessons on drawabox.com. I'll post my progress here as I go. I've heard it's tedious but I also don't want to skip the fundamentals and regret it later. Plus, I find repetitive tasks to be relaxing. Who knows, maybe I'll also throw in a couple creative posts every now and then if I have time.

## Circle Central

Circles, or rather ellipses, are much harder to do properly than lines. I keep wanting to rely on my wrist instead of my arm to control the motion. I did the circle inside the plane exercise near the end, and I feel that my circles had improved by that point. It took me about an hour to do this exercise. Who knew drawing circles could take so long? I was glad they let us re-use the planes from the previous exercise.

Though tedious, these exercises are pretty relaxing, and I was able to listen to the *Writing Excuses* podcast as I was drawing the ellipses. If you're a fiction writer, I highly recommend this podcast -- the hosts are funny and cover a diverse set of topics related to writing. And if you're like me and are not sure what to write abbout, they always give a writing prompt at the end of the show. I hardly find time to listen to podcasts since I walk to school, so I was pretty excited that I was able to find the time.

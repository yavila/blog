Hi! I'm Yami, I'm a software engineer who also wants to do something creative on the side. What kind of creative thing? Well, right now I'm going to focus on drawing, but I could see myself diving into writing stories or poetry in the future.

If you're wondering why my logo is a pineapple, it's because they are cool. Yep.
